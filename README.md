# Kilobotics
This project is part of lab work (SC626) under guidance of Prof. Leena Vachhani, Prof. Arpita Sinha and Anurag Gupta (TA).

Kilobots are low cost robots designed at Harvard Universityâ€™s Self-Organizing Systems Research Lab http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr. 
The robots are designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers.

In this project, we have designed an algorithm where each Kilobot to form gradient with respect to reference Kilobotbot and 
then bring the farthest Kilobotbot near the reference Kilobot by using edge following approach.
